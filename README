This module is an example of how to build testing modules with
Test::Builder and how to test them with Test::Builder::Tester.

You probably don't want to install it, it does nothing useful.
However, the code is heavly commented, and I hope that reading it you
should gain some understanding of how these things can be done.

If for some mad reason you *do* want to install it, simply do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install  # as root

You may have to use your local version of "make" to install - for
example on MS Windows you'll want to download Microsoft's "nmake"
utility.
